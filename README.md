## Introduction

This project focuses on analysing the Unemployment rate in some cities in India over the period from 2019-2020. The dataset contains valuable information about key parameters about Employment details across India in communities like Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Sikkim. The objective of this project is to extract insights from the data to make inform decison-making  within India on the issue of Unemployment rate and number of Individuals Employed  
## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from kaggle data catalogue, accesible at the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india

## Data Processing

### Importing Data

I started by importing the dataset from the source. The data contains columns for several columns like Area, Region, Estimated Unemployment Rate (%), Estimated Employed, Estimated Labour Participation, Frequency

### Data Cleaning and Transformation 
I performed Data cleaning and transformation to ensure the consistency of the dataset. This includes removing empty columns to make sure I am not processing a zero data, ensuring there's no outlier, also ensuring there's no duplicate data and the data was ready for processing.

 ### Analysis and Insights 
I conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to extract meaningful insights that could aid decision -making. This includes showing plots to better understand such as:

- List of all Regions 
- Classification of the regions into the Urban and Rural regions
- How the the regions fare over the period in terms of their Rate of Unemployment and number of people Employed 
- The regions with the highest and lowest Unemployment Rate and Number Of People Employed 
- The relationship between each data columns 
 

## Summary and Findings
 The Project findings are documented in the `Rate of Unemployement in India.pdf` file. This include a narrative of the insights and findings on the dataset
